# NLP-stop-asking-how-was-your-day

# Summary

#### How many times when you try to start a converstaion with your kids by asking "How was the day?" and get a response from:
```random.choice('fine','not bad','good','okay')```
#### And nothing more, conversation ends.

#### The problem lies in in the question. It's too EFFORTFUL for kids to come up with something worth talking when it's just a normal day. To reduce the effort of starting a conversation with kids, you  need to ask more specific and intriguing questions that they want to talk about. And more importantly, to reduce the effort for parents to think about those topics, you need this book.(at least I do)
#### "Stop asking how was your day" provides 444 questions that helps you ask detailed, thoughful and inspiring questions to start a qulity conversation with your kids. This project is trying to study these questions and create an agent that can ask numerous good questions like those in the book.
